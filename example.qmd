format: 
  html:
    theme: unilur.scss
filters:
  - unilur
show-solution: true
---

## Usage

- **Activate** the extension by adding the following lines to your YAML header:

``` yaml
filters:
  - unilur
show-solution: true # or false
```

- **Solution** code blocks are **highlighted** or ~~discarded~~ according to the chunk option `unilur-solution` Boolean and the global option `show-solution` in the YAML header.

Of note, if `show-solution` is absent, it is considered `false`.


### Example with `unilur-solution: true`

- Code chunk with `echo: fenced`

```{r}
#| unilur-solution: true
#| echo: fenced

1 + 1
```

- Code block _without_ solution, so stays in whatever happens

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

1 + 1
```

- Solution with `unilur-collapse: false` 

```{r}
#| unilur-solution: true
#| unilur-collapse: false

1 + 2
```
