title: "Unilur Example"
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
filters:
  - unilur
solution: true

## Usage

- **Activate** the extension by adding the following lines to your YAML header:

``` yaml
filters:
  - unilur
```

- **Solution** code blocks are **highlighted** or ~~discarded~~ according to the `solution` Boolean and the YAML header:

``` yaml
solution: true # or false
```

Of note, if `solution` is absent, it is considered `false`.


### Example with `solution: true`

- Code chunk with `echo: fenced`

```{r}
#| solution: true
#| echo: fenced

1 + 1
```

- Code block _without_ solution, so stays in whatever happens

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

1 + 1
```

- Solution with `collapse: true` 

```{r}
#| solution: true
#| collapse: true

1 + 2
```
